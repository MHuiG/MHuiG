Thank you if you like this profile README!

BUT, please DO NOT copy this and create your profile based on it.

You can use it as a reference, and copy a part of it, but DO NOT copy
all of this and create your profile based on it.

It is very common that you forget to change some information and leave
mine in your profile. 🤣🤣🤣

What's more, you can find other awesome profile READMEs at
https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme. There
could be a profile README that fits you better than this one.

Wish you a good-looking profile README!
